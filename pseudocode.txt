Set up

Initial Page
- header at the top with the name
- immediately below the header is a form with a text input for a name, a checkbox which disables the name input so the user can remain anonymous, and a textarea input for a message
- below the form is a list of all the messages entered before
- initialize Firebase

Adding messages to the page
- event listener on the form on submit
  - grabs the values from the text input and textarea
    - if there is a name in the text input, use the name, else use anonymous
  - sets the state of form to empty
  - add a new message object to Firebase that includes the author, date, and message
  - on updating the value in Firebase, set the state of the message board to include the new comment
  - do the above in a useEffect hook tied to the userInput state
- event listener on like
  - register when like button is clicked
  - update Firebase likes property on message
  - render message on page

States
- userInput state for the form
- messageBoard state for the list of messages

Firebase
- top level is filled with boards objects
- each boards object has a topicName and an array of messages
  - stretch goal is to add permissions on who can see each board
- each messages array is filled with messages objects
- each messages object has a name, date, and message
  - the stretch goal is to include a comments object on each message, which can nest more comment objects and a likes property which tracks the number of likes
